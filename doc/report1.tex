\title Design of library for controlling a liquid handling robot

\section Levels of abstraction
The library distinguishes between 5 different levels of command abstraction.
Abstract syntax tree
Translating among levels

\subsection Level 0
We currently implement this level for Tecan's Evoware software by generating Evoware scripts (.esc files).
The commands available on this level are therefore those provided by Evoware.

\subsection Level 1
At level 1 define low-level commands (e.g. aspirate, dispense, mix, transfer, etc.) whose parameters are generic enough to abstract way from the concrete commands available for a particular liquid handling robot.
At the moment, the commands I'm working on are.

\subsection Level 2

\subsection Level 3

\subsection Level 4
