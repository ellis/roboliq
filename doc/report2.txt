Extensions to RoboEase:
	- more tip handling options (our tips aren't discardable -- lots of different ways to clean them)
	- cooled plates
	- pluggable devices
	- portable protocols
	- tip handling information somehow encoded in the liquid definitions
	- user-defined functions
	- potential optimization

How commands and plugins work together:
	- plugins register to handle level 2 & 3 commands
	- if multiple plugins register for the same command, the last one which registered will be chosen

Questions:
	- how to deal with feedback?
