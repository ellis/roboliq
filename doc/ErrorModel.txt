Error Model
===========

Action
------

A(Ws, Wd, V, T, M)
where
Ws: source well
Wd: destination well
V: volume
T: tip type
M: pipetting method

Change of state:

- each action can potentially impact the every well on the table
- each action can only impact a given well


L1 = Rem(T(1), M(1), V(1), W1)
L3 = Add(T(2), M(2), V(2), W2, Add(T(1), M(1), V(1), W1, W3))

L3 = [P(50, L1), P(25, L2), P(HELP)]

VOL: a probability distribution over volume; for example, if the normal distribution is chosen, then we need the parameters for mean volume and standard deviation.

Model 1
-------

For m liquids and n wells, an m x n matrix with mean and stddev of each liquid in each well.

The problem with this method is that it can't be used to maximize the correlation between wells which should have similar contents.

Model 2
-------

For n wells, an n x n matrix with mean and stddev of the contents of each source well in each well; also an n-vector with the volume (with mean and stddev) removed from each well.

Assumptions
-----------

* All sources are well mixed

Overall value to minimize
-------------------------

Sum of relative variability of each entry in the model matrix.

If VOL is represented as a normal distribution, for example, the variability could be given by $\sigma / \mu$.
