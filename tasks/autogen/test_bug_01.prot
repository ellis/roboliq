  Toubleshooting why a threat was no recognized
  between centrifugeRun and readerRun
  from tania08_urea_test, 22:transportLabware should have origin location = CENTRIFUGE_2, not P3
  Why does 12:transportLabware not recognize that 10:transportLabware has moved mixPlate from REGRIP to CENTRIGUE_2?

labware:
  balancePlate:
    description: balance plate for centrifuge
    model: plateModel_384_square
    location: P2
  mixPlate:
    description: plate for target mixtures
