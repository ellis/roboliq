Planner Notes
=============

Planner experiences
-------------------

pddl4j: nice PDDL3 parser
pddl4j/Graphplan: ignores negative preconditions on actions
tempo-sat-sgplan6: written in C; seems to work; a small inconvenience is that there needs to be at least one object instance of every type
javaff: doesn't handle negative preconditions
Metric-FF: doesn't handling typing
seq-sat-lama: didn't like my pddl problem file
