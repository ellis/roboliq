  We want to have an iteration per well, where the corresponding components are mixed and fluorescence intensity is measured over time before we get to the next iteration for the next well.

  Q: What shall we do about piercing, since it damages the large tips?

      A sealed 96-well plate where each well has a solution of one unlabeled DNA.
      (Note: some wells will have the solution of the same unlabeled DNA in order to have replicates for
      our measurements, but in principle each well will have the same labeled DNA but different
      unlabeled DNA)
