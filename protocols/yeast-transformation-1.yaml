  Yeast transformation with lithium acetate and plasmid DNA

  Input information:

  - N: number of transformations
  - X: amount of liquid plated (ul)

  Starting resources:

  - Cell culture tube
  - LiAc
  - Master mix
  - DNA to transform on a microtitier/PCR plate
  - LB container
  - Slightly dried agar plates with an antibiotic
  - PVD filter plate
  - Waste plate (see Test waste plate)

  Protocol:

  - Pipet 350 ul into N wells on a PVD filter plate
  - Stack PVD filter plate on waste plate
  - Prepare a counter weight either by pipetting same volumes on identical plates or having a DW plate
  - Move the balance to the centrifuge
  - Move the stack to centrifuge
  - Run a suitable time and rpm (see Test centrifugation)
  - Move the stack out
  - Move the balance out
  - Move the filter plate on an empty site
  - Resuspend the pellet on the filter plate into 300 ul water (or max volume)
  - Move the plate on top of the stack
  - Fill the balance with water matching to the added volume
  - Move the stack to the centrifuge
  - Move the balance to the centrifuge
  - Run a suitable time and rpm
  - Move the stack out
  - Move the balance out
  - Move the filter plate on an empty site
  - Resuspend the cells with LiAc (is the volume high enough?)
  - Cover with a lid
  - Incubate 30 min in RT
  - Meanwhile, apply viscous master mix on a PCR plate (see Test pipetting the viscous liquids)
  - Add the DNA from the plate to the PCR plate
  - Uncover the filter plate
  - Add the incubated cells on the PCR plate with MM
  - Move the PCR plate in a thermocycler
  - Heat shock in a thermocycler for 30 mins
  - Meanwhile, pipet 0.8 ml of LB on a deep well plate
  - Move the plate out of the thermocycler
  - Transfer each transformation (200 ul) on the deep well plate
  - Move the deep well plate into the
  - Move the deep well plate in the shaker incubator
  - Incubate the plate in 30C for 4h
  - Plate x ul of each culture on agar plates
