pH
==

Balance plate
-------------

script: tania13_ph_1_balancePlate_mario.esc

Preparation:

- [ ] make sure centrifuge is empty
- [ ] place 384 well OptiPlate on P2
- [ ] run script

Information:
- The script uses system liquid, so you don't need any other labware
- 375 wells will be filled to 75ul
- The balance plate will end up in centrifuge bay 4


Pipetting
---------

script: tania13_ph_2_pipette_mario.esc

Preparation:

- [ ] prepare the labware and reagents as described below
- [ ] make sure centrifuge bay 2 is empty
- [ ] run script

Volumes:

- GFPs: 375ul + dead volume
- Buffers: almost 500ul per well + dead volume



Measurement
-----------

script: tania13_ph_3_measure_mario.esc

Preparation:

- [ ] The "mixPlate" should be at P3 when the script start.
- [ ] You will probably need to adapt the reader's script -- please do so by double-clicking on the "Measure" command of the script from within Evoware.  That will bring up an i-Control window from which you can make your modifications.
- [ ] Change the time between readouts, if you wish.  It's currently set to 4 hours in the last command of the script.
