# Notes

When loading JSON/JavaScript files, we expect the following structure:

    {
      objects: {},
      steps: {},
      effects: {},
      predicates: [],
      taskPredicates: [],
      objectToPredicateConverters: {function},
      commandHandlers: {function},
      planHandlers: {function}
    }

# Misc

- SHOP code from http://danm.ucsc.edu/~wsack/SoftwareArts/Code/Plan/

# Variables

Need to reference objects, variables, step parameters, parameters of current command, parameters of parent command

* "${object}" -- `object` parameter for current command
* "${^.object}" -- `object` parameter for parent command
* "${1.2.object}" -- `object` parameter for step 1.2
* "@{volume}" -- the value of `objects.volume.value`
* "@{${object}.location}" -- the location of the object referenced by the `object` parameter for the current command

# Pipetting optimization

For fixed tips:

* Which tips to use?  Large or small?
* Washing when necessary
* Which program ("liquid class") to use?
* How to group tip tips and wells?
* Washing is deterministic

Assigning tips to sources:

* Try to assign one tip model to each source.  If that doesn't work, assign the optimal tip model for each pipetting step from that source.

Tuple: (source, destination, volume, flags, tipModel, tip, program, pre-commands, post-commands)

"#wells#plate1(A01 down 4)"

    A01 down [take] 4
    A01 down [to] D01
    A01 down block [to] B02
    A01 right [take] 4
    A01 right [to] A04
    A01 right block [to] B02
    all random(seed)
    all random(seed) take 1
    all free take 4
    all free random(seed) take 4

Simplest methods/algorithms:

1. Only use one tip
2. Use each tip, rotating through them till they need to be washed
3. Group as many tips at once as possible
4. Group as many tips at once as possible, but if group splits over columns, see if we can get a longer contiguous group by restarting the grouping in the new column rather than splitting the group from the previous column

Modularize the methods more:

- break the items into groups that should be handled simultaneously, possible methods include:
    - each item is its own group
    - groups are built until no more syringes would be available based on the item's tipModel (but syringe doesn't need to be assigned yet)
    - groups are built (with limited look-ahead) where alternatives are investigated when a group splits over two columns
    - have a fixed assignment between wells and syringes (i.e. row n = tip (n % 4)) for the sake of managing differences between tips
- assign syringes by group for items without an assigned syringe
- assign source well by group for items without assigned source wells; if multiple syringes need to access the same source, and that source has multiple wells, then possible methods include:
    - pick first one
    - rotate through source wells in order
    - rotate through source wells in order of max volume
    - try a simple geometrical assignment considering whether there are more tips or wells; if that fails, use previous method
    - same as above, but if wells > tips, try starting at first (wells - tips) wells and see which one produces the greatest minimum final volume
- add cleaning actions between each group, at the beginning, and at the end

A completely different method that would sometimes useful to manage tip differences:

## Cleaning tips

cleanBegin: intensity of first cleaning at beginning of pipetting, before first aspiration.
Priority: item.cleanBefore || params.cleanBegin || params.clean || source.cleanBefore || "thorough"

cleanBetween: intensity of cleaning between groups.
Priority: max(previousCleanAfter, (item.cleanBefore || params.cleanBetween || params.clean || source.cleanBefore || "thorough"))

previousCleanAfter = item.cleanAfter || if (!params.cleanBetween) source.cleanAfter

cleanEnd: intensity of cleaning after pipetting is done.
Priority: max(previousCleanAfter, params.cleanEnd || params.clean || "thorough")


# Encoding content

Several ideas for how to encode content.  Currently I prefer `plate1(C01)` below, using the arrays.

        "contents": {
            "plate1(A01)": "(water=25ul+asdf=5ul)@?-10ul",
            "plate1(B01)": {
                "contents": [
                    {"contents": "water", "AMOUNT":"25ul"},
                    {"contents": "asdf", "AMOUNT":"5ul"}
                ],
                "amount": "?-10ul"
            },
            "plate1(C01)": ["?ul-10ul", ["25ul", "water"], ["5ul", "asdf"]]
        },


# Combinatorial stuff

somehow distinguish between control factors, nuisance factors, blocking factors, measurable factors, unknown factors

- factor: [protein, volume]
  values: [[gfp, 10], [gfp, 20], [gfp, 30], [yfp, 5]]
- factor: something else
  values: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- "#tabfile#factor3.tab"
- "#csvdata#protein,volume\ngfp,10\ngfp,20\ngfp,30\nyfp,5"

For comprehensions

type: Eval.List
type: Eval.Wells

    "1": {
        "command": "pipetter.action.pipette",
        "items": {
            "type": "Eval.List",
            "variables": [{
                "name": ["source", "volume"],
                "values": [["water", "10ul"], ["reagent1", "20ul"]]
            }, {
                "name": "destination",
                "values": "#wells#plate1(A02 down 8)"
            }],
            "order": ["-volume"],
            "template": {
                "source": "{{source}}",
                "destination": "{{destination}}",
                "volume": "{{volume}}"
            }
        }
    }

    for:
    - [source, volume] in [[water, 10ul], [reagent1, 20ul]]
    - destination in plate1(A02 down 8)
    template:
      source: {{source}}
      destination: {{destination}}
      volume: {{volume}}

      - {source: water, destination: plate1(A02), volume: 10ul}
      - {source: water, destination: plate1(B02), volume: 10ul}

          volume: 60ul

## Command Reports

An example of a command report/table would be for the reader command.
The reader will read a plate and produce an output file.  To analyze it,
we need to know what the contents of the plate were.
So the command should create a report of the well contents before readout.

    reports:
        step-2:
            {}
