# TODOs for roboliq

- [x] Create titationSeries command
- [x] TitrationSeries: handle multiple volumes for a given step, for grouping
- [x] TitrationSeries: handle reagent without volume, to use as filler
- [x] TitrationSeries: handle multiple reagents for a given step, for grouping
- [x] TitrationSeries: BUG: for the multi-source step, all aspirations are happening from a single well
- [x] Speed up pipetting algorithm -- need to get it fast enough to handle 384 well plate
- [x] TitrationSeries: fix hack for stepToList_l in TitrationSeriesSub()
- [x] TitrationSeries: allow for alternative fillers
- [ ] Print out liquid usage for source wells, so I know how much we need to put in
  - [ ] print a table sorted by plate name, column, row
  - [ ] for reagents, print a table with these columns: plate, column, row, well index name, initial volume, final volume, volume change, dead volume, min volume recommended
  - [ ] Create csv with these columns: well name, row, col, tip, pipette sequence number, multipipette sequence number, volume, liquid class, reagent, labware model, site, [plate name], [experiment name]
- [ ] EvowareClientScriptBuilder: update tip state in spirate_checked
- [ ] EvowareClientScriptBuilder: update well state in spirate_checked
- [ ] EvowareClientScriptBuilder: add well events in spirate_checked
- [ ] TitrationSeries: let user explicitly specify number of replicates
- [ ] TitrationSeries: randomize dispenses, with a randomSeed property
- [ ] TitrationSeries: allow user to specify the sort order (e.g., the third component could be the primary grouping)

- [ ] let user specify initial volume for a reagent
- [ ] add 'deadVolume' property to labwareModel, indicated the extra volume required in a well for aspiration
- [ ] keep track of minimum and maximum volumes in a well, and warn or produce errors when these are out of bounds
- [ ] TitrationSeries: allow use of more than one target plate
- [ ] TitrationSeries: create better data structure that supports recursive components and alternatives, and allows for different total volumes 
- [ ] pipetting: should sterilize tips before first aspirate (see tania01 without the sterilizeBefore spec)
- [ ] tania??: uria will require a thorough post-cleaning
- [ ] A '.' in a reagent name causes eb.lookupLiquidSource not to work for that reagent
- [ ] Ask Fabian about a verb for the TitrationSeries command: titrate
- [ ] TitrationSeries: filter out 0-volume dispenses
- [ ] TitrationSeries/PipetteSpec: allow for a list of volumes rather than just a single volume
- [ ] TitrationSeries: handle min/max reagent, ranging the volume over the available wells
- [ ] TitrationSeries: handle concentrations in addition to volumes
- [ ] Consider making paths in config file relative to the config file itself
- [ ] Refactor the Converter code, and make more use of parsers
- [ ] Commands should be able to each produce their own reports, e.g. for TitrationSeries, showing a table with the contents of the wells
