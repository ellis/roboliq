- [ ] Ask Fabian about a verb for the TitrationSeries command
- [ ] TitrationSeries: filter out 0-volume dispenses
- [ ] TitrationSeries/PipetteSpec: allow for a list of volumes rather than just a single volume
- [ ] TitrationSeries: handle min/max reagent, ranging the volume over the available wells
- [ ] TitrationSeries: handle concentrations in addition to volumes
- [ ] Consider making paths in config file relative to the config file itself
