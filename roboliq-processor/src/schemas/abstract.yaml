    The `abstract` commands describe tasks without specifying the equipment will be used to
    execute the task.  For example, `abstract.incubate` can be used to incubate a plate,
    but leaves open whether to use a dedicated incubator or other equipment,
    such as a temperature-controlled centrifuge.

          program:
            rpm: 3000
            duration: 1s # must set a duration of at least 1s
