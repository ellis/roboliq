Experiments:
- [x] Find best orange
- [x] Try to get brown by darkening the orange
- [x] Find best brown
- [x] For the transparent plate, find dye concentrations for optimal saturation
	- [x] Create dilution series
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [-] Record RGB values of dilutions
- [ ] Test impact of black dye on various colors
	- [x] Create script testing dilutions of primary colors with four dilutions of black (3,6,12,24ul 1:16 K)
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [ ] Record RGB values of dilutions
- [ ] Get another couple white 384 plates from the lab
- [ ] Run black series and mixtures on white 384 plate too
- [ ] Record cyan value (low volume blue)
- [ ] Run the series on a 96 well plate too
- [ ] Does it look better to have larger water volume in the transparent 384 plate?

Evoware:
- [ ] Test whether Aspirate and Dispense commands can go into gwl files
- [ ] Try to get the sealer to work

Manual lab work:
- [ ] Get 6 troughs
- [ ] Mix dilutions of dye in the troughs
- [ ] Test sealer with our plates
- [ ] Take tape off of safety sensors

Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Decide on dye dilutions to use
- [ ] Decide on best final well volume
- [ ] Use of small tips is too slow.  Use a more diluted solution.
- [ ] Reprogram to use the troughs
- [ ] Calculate how much of each source is used for each script
- [ ] Program it to work on 96 well plates too
- [ ] Seal the plate
- [ ] Estimate time to print?
- [ ] Adjust concentrations based on the plate type (*2 for transparent, *7 for 96-well)

UI:
- [ ] Create a better drawing interface!
- [ ] More pictures
- [ ] Even more pictures!

- [ ] Let users write letters
- [ ] Overlapping color picker?  With white/black slide too?
