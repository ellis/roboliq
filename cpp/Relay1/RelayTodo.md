Colors:
4 levels of red
4 levels of blue
4 levels of black
light yellow/yellow/orange/brown/dark brown
3 levels of green?
purples?

Smallest volumes required (all on white 384 plate):
R: 0.010 for orange and light brown => 3ul = 1:300 dilution
Y: 0.05 for light yellow => 3ul = 1:75 dilution
B: 0.039 for lightest blue => 3ul = 1:77 dilution
K: 0.0073 for brown => 3ul = 1:411 dilution

Largest volumes required (all on white 384 plate):
R: 0.21 for red
Y: 0.31 for orange
B: 0.31 for blue
K: 0.13 for black

Max/Min volumes:
R: 21 : need two dilutions, 1 for red and an extra one for orange and light brown
Y: 6.2 : only need one dilution for yellow, 3ul for min, 19ul for max
B: 8 : only need one dilution for blue, 3ul for min, 24ul for max
K: 18 : need two dilutions, one for black and one for brown

Dilutions:
R: 1:29 (transparent), 1:75 (transparent orange), 1:230 (white), 1:600 (orange and brown)
Y: 1:30 (transparent), 1:5 (transparent orange), 1:240 (white), 1:39 (orange and brown)
B: 1:20 (transparent), 1:155 (white)
K: 1:47 (transparent), 1:205 (transparent brown), 1:370 (white), 1:1644 (brown)

Maybe instead:
Y: 1:3, 1:30, 1:240
K: 1:47, 1:370, (remove 1:1644?)

Experiments:
- [x] Find best orange
- [x] Try to get brown by darkening the orange
- [x] Find best brown
- [x] For the transparent plate, find dye concentrations for optimal saturation
	- [x] Create dilution series
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [-] Record RGB values of dilutions
- [x] Get another couple white 384 plates from the lab and some more eppendorfs
- [x] Create script for chosen dilutions using eppendorfs
- [x] Find best purple
- [x] Create script for color chart
	- [x] light yellow/yellow/orange/brown/dark brown
	- [x] 3 levels of green
	- [x] purples?
- [x] Halve the concentrations for 384 white except yellow, double them for 384 transparent, so transparent is 8x more concentrated
- [x] Run black series and mixtures on white 384 plate too
- [x] Test impact of black dye on various colors
	- [x] Create script testing dilutions of primary colors with four dilutions of black (3,6,12,24ul 1:16 K)
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [-] Record RGB values of dilutions
!*- [ ] Do test run with troughs
!*- [ ] Record RGB values for color chart
!*- [ ] Print at least 5 different pictures
- [ ] Does it look better to have larger water volume in the transparent 384 plate?
- [ ] Print at least 5 different pictures
- [ ] Run the series on a 96 well plate too

Coordination:
- [x] Email everyone about times to show up
- [x] Ask Urs about screws for door locks
- [-] Email Lena to ask her to find printouts about RYB mixing
- [x] Print some printouts about RYB mixing

Evoware:
- [-] Try to get the sealer to work
- [ ] Test whether Aspirate and Dispense commands can go into gwl files

Manual lab work:
- [-] Test sealer with our plates
- [x] Get 6 troughs
- [x] Take tape off of safety sensors
- [x] Screw in the door locks
- [ ] Get some blank white printer paper to lay transparent plates on for viewing
- [ ] Fill up system liquid

Basic Functionality:
- [x] Round volumes to 0.1 ul
- [x] Decide on dye dilutions to use
- [x] Use of small tips is too slow.  Use a more diluted solution.
- [x] Create function to create color chart worklist (with about 24 colors)
!*- [ ] Reprogram to use the troughs
!*- [ ] Given the measurements, build a list of colors we can mix
*- [ ] Decide on best final well volume
- [ ] Calculate how much of each source is used for each script
- [ ] Reduce colors by converting to mixtures, then back to RGB.

- [ ] Program it to work on 96 well plates too?
- [ ] Estimate time to print?
- [ ] Adjust concentrations based on the plate type (*2 for transparent, *7 for 96-well)

UI:
*- [ ] Let user pick colors
*- [ ] Create a sidebar scrollable list of pictures
- [ ] Create a better drawing interface!
- [ ] More pictures
- [ ] Even more pictures!
- [ ] Let user pick which color layers to show (RYBK)
- [ ] Let users write letters (with what colors or gradients?)
- [ ] Overlapping color picker?  With white/black slide too?

Maaruthy:
- [x] good purple
- [x] Mix dilutions of dye in the troughs

Gintas:
- [x] clean plates
- [x] look for low-res pictures
