Colors:
4 levels of red
4 levels of blue
4 levels of black
light yellow/yellow/orange/brown/dark brown
3 levels of green?
purples?

Smallest volumes required (all on white 384 plate):
R: 0.010 for orange and light brown => 3ul = 1:300 dilution
Y: 0.05 for light yellow => 3ul = 1:75 dilution
B: 0.039 for lightest blue => 3ul = 1:77 dilution
K: 0.0073 for brown => 3ul = 1:411 dilution

Largest volumes required (all on white 384 plate):
R: 0.21 for red
Y: 0.31 for orange
B: 0.31 for blue
K: 0.13 for black

Max/Min volumes:
R: 21 : need two dilutions, 1 for red and an extra one for orange and light brown
Y: 6.2 : only need one dilution for yellow, 3ul for min, 19ul for max
B: 8 : only need one dilution for blue, 3ul for min, 24ul for max
K: 18 : need two dilutions, one for black and one for brown

Dilutions:
R: 1:115, 1:300 (tube?)
Y: 1:75
B: 1:77
K: 1:185, 1:411 (tube?)

Experiments:
- [x] Find best orange
- [x] Try to get brown by darkening the orange
- [x] Find best brown
- [x] For the transparent plate, find dye concentrations for optimal saturation
	- [x] Create dilution series
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [-] Record RGB values of dilutions
- [x] Get another couple white 384 plates from the lab and some more eppendorfs
- [x] Create script for chosen dilutions using eppendorfs
- [ ] Create script for color chart
	- [x] light yellow/yellow/orange/brown/dark brown
1	- [ ] 3 levels of green?
2	- [ ] purples?
- [ ] Halve the concentrations for 384 white, double them for 384 transparent, so transparent is 8x more concentrated
- [ ] Run black series and mixtures on white 384 plate too
- [ ] Test impact of black dye on various colors
	- [x] Create script testing dilutions of primary colors with four dilutions of black (3,6,12,24ul 1:16 K)
	- [x] Photo of dilution series
	- [ ] Record RGB values of dilutions
- [ ] Find best purple
- [ ] Record cyan value (low volume blue)
- [ ] Run the series on a 96 well plate too
- [ ] Does it look better to have larger water volume in the transparent 384 plate?
- [ ] might reduce saturation by removing liquid from a well?
- [ ] might want to dilute red-for-orange another 2-8 times in order to get saturations of orange?

Coordination:
- [x] Email everyone about times to show up
- [x] Ask Urs about screws for door locks
- [ ] Email Lena to ask her to find printouts about RYB mixing

Evoware:
- [-] Try to get the sealer to work
3- [ ] Test whether Aspirate and Dispense commands can go into gwl files

Manual lab work:
- [-] Test sealer with our plates
- [x] Get 6 troughs
- [x] Take tape off of safety sensors
- [x] Screw in the door locks
- [ ] Mix dilutions of dye in the troughs
- [ ] Get some blank white printer paper to lay transparent plates on for viewing

Basic Functionality:
4- [ ] Create function to create color chart worklist (with about 21 colors)
- [ ] Given the measurements, build a list of colors we can mix
- [ ] Round volumes to 0.1 ul
- [ ] Decide on dye dilutions to use
- [ ] Decide on best final well volume
- [ ] Use of small tips is too slow.  Use a more diluted solution.
- [ ] Reprogram to use the troughs
- [ ] Calculate how much of each source is used for each script
- [ ] Program it to work on 96 well plates too
- [ ] Seal the plate
- [ ] Estimate time to print?
- [ ] Adjust concentrations based on the plate type (*2 for transparent, *7 for 96-well)

UI:
- [ ] Create a better drawing interface!
- [ ] More pictures
- [ ] Even more pictures!
- [ ] Let user pick which color layers to show (RYBK)
- [ ] Let users write letters (with what colors or gradients?)
- [ ] Overlapping color picker?  With white/black slide too?
