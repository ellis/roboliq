        `planAlternativeChoosers` is a map from a predicate ID to a function
        that takes a list of possible alternatives for that predicate.
        The function can then choose one of those alternatives by returning
        it.  This allows you to configure planning preferences, such as if
        you have two shakers, you might always prefer to use a specific one
        when it's among the alternatives.
