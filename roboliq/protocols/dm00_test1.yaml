  Goal: Quantify the impact of measurement on the growth curve.

  The growth curve has two plateaus: around 16h and 48h.

  There is a limit to how many times a well can be measured, because we need to extract material from it for each measurement.

  All wells should probably be measured at the end around 48h (but this takes time, so they can't be measured simultaneously).

  Measurement(s) should be performed every 15 minutes.
  A plate has 96 wells.  If one measurement is performed every 15 minutes, 192
  measurements are performed in 48h.  If one measurement is made per well,
  then we need exactly 2 plates.  If each well is instead measured twice, we
  would only need 1 plate.

  There are complications with measuring a well multiple times: quantifying
  the impact of removing volume for measurement, and quantifying the impact
  of evaporation after the first measurement punctures the well's seal.

  Once a well is measured, its seal gets punctured, and evaporation will occur.
  We need to quantify the impact of evaporation on cell growth.  But how can
  we disentangle the effect of measurement from the effect of evaporation?

  Idea:
  Have one plate.  Wells are paired: in each pair, one is pre-punctured and
  the other isn't.
  Every well will be measured 2 to 4 times (24, 16, or 12 hours apart).

  growth ~ f(t, t_puncture, t_measurements, measurements)

  Also need to quantify the impact on growth of the shaker configuration --
  i.e. the plate's position in the shaker and how many plates are
  in the shaker.  In addition, we'll need to quantify the impact of well position
  on a plate in a shaker position.

  Q: How long does it take to measure one well?

          items:
          - dilutionPlate: dilutionPlate1
            sampleWell: A01

          - dilutionPlate: dilutionPlate1
            sampleWell: A06
            dilutionWells: A07,A08,A09,A10
          - dilutionPlate: dilutionPlate1
            sampleWell: A11
            dilutionWells: A12,A13,A14,A15

more complicated stuff:
  - should perhaps define conditions for a single well on the puncturePlate and make 8 replicates of that
  - the single well on the puncturePlate should be associated with four wells on the dilutionPlate (due to four separate measurements at 12h, 24h, 36h, 48h)
  - each of those four wells on the dilutionPlate should in turn be associated with 4 or 5 more wells to be used for the dilution series
  - and then, despite the fact that each well on the puncturePlate was defined separately, we should somehow group them together so that all 8 wells are pipetted simultaneously
  - one possible solution would be to have the experiment.run command allow the user to control grouping and orderings, similar to dplyr in R?  Could consider the syntax of jmespath.
