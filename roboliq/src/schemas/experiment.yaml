experiment:
  module: |
    The `experiment` module is for working with experimental designs.
    Currently there is only one command, `experiment.run`.

experiment.run:
  description: |
    Run an experiment based on a Design or the currently available `DATA` object.
    This command will performs its sub-steps for every item in the experiment array, placing the item's values in SCOPE."
  properties:
    agent: {description: "Agent identifier", type: "Agent"}
    design: {description: "An experimental design to use", type: "Design"}
    groupBy: {description: "The factor(s) to group by", type: [array, string], items: {type: string}}
    duration: {description: "The total duration of this step (all groups should execute within the allotted time)", type: Duration}
    interleave: {description: "The time offset for interleaving each group", type: Duration}
    timers: {description: "Timers that should be used", type: array, items: {type: Timer}}
    startTimerAfterStep: {description: "The duration timer will be started after this step rather than from the beginning, if specified", type: integer}
    steps: {description: "The sequence of commands to perform for each set of factor values.", type: "object"}
  required: [groupBy]

experiment.forEachGroup:

    Run an experiment based on a Design or the currently available `DATA` object.
    This command will performs its sub-steps for every selected group of items in the experiment array."
