pipetter.pipetteDilutionSeries:
  description: |
    Pipette a dilution series.

    First the diluent is distributed to the destination wells (if diluent is specified).
    Then the source is transfered to the first destination well of each item (if source is specified -- otherwise the first destination well is assumed to be already prepared).
    Then aliquots are serially transfered from the first destination well to the next, and so on for each item.
    In general, mixing should be performed after each dilution dispense, and perhaps also before the first aspriation -- this can be specified how ???
