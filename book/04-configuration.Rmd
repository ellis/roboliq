# Robot configuration

In order for Roboliq to compile your protocol for your robot setup, it needs to know how the robot is configured.  This is the most complicated part of Roboliq -- it requires advanced technical knowledge or your robot and some programming skill.  Once the configuraiton has been specified, future users don't need to be concerned with it.

So if someone else has configured Roboliq for your robot already, then you should probably just proceed to the next chapter.
However, if you need to write the configuration, this chapter is for you.

## Components

A *configuration* is a JavaScript object with the following properties:

* `roboliq`: specifies the version of Roboliq.
* `objects`: specifies the objects provided by the robot.
* `commandHandlers`: specifies the functions that handle protocol commands, for example by generating low-level commands from high-level commands.
* `predicates`:  specifies the *logical predicates* used by Roboliq's A.I. to figure out how to compile some high-level commands to low-level commands for this configuration.
* `objectToPredicateConverters`: specifies functions that generate logical predicates based from `objects`.
* `planHandlers`: specifies the functions that transform logical tasks into commands.

The first three properties are specified with "standard" JavaScript: `roboliq` takes a string value, `objects` takes an object value, and `commandHandlers` takes a hash map of functions.
The last three properties, in contrast, are related to Roboliq's A.I. and will require some effort to understand.

## "Standard" components

The standard JavaScript components are described in more detail in this section.

### `roboliq`

As with protocols, the first property of a configuration should be `roboliq: v1`.

### `objects`

CONTINUE
typically more complex than `objects` in protocols.
Namespaces are used to build nested objects.

### `commandHandlers`

CONTINUE

## Logical components

Roboliq uses an Articifial Intelligence method called [Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_task_network).
