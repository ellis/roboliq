# Preface {-}

This manual will show you how to write high-level protocols that can be executed on multiple robotic platforms.
We introduce *Roboliq*, a software system for automating lab protocols using liquid handling robots.
Roboliq support high-level commands that make it much easier to write automation protocols, especially complex ones.
It then generates the low-level commands that for your robot system (currently only Tecan Evoware).

## Structure of the manual {-}

* Chapter 1 "Introduction" gives a quick overview of how to use Roboliq.
* Chatper 2 "Quick start" is a practical walk-through for writing Roboliq protocols and compiling them.
* Chapter 3 "Input formats" describes several formats that Roboliq accepts for writing protocols.
* Chapter 4 "Robot configuration" describes how to write robot configurations that Roboliq uses to turn high-level commands into low-level instructions.
* Chapter 5 "Protocols" describes the structure of Roboliq protocols in detail.
* Chapter 6 "Design tables" describes a how to represent experimental designs in a tree or table format, and how these can be used to concisely define complex experiments.
* Chapter 7 "Compiling protocols" describes how to compile your protocols for a target robot.
* Chapter 8 "Output files" describes the files created when compilinig protocols and how you can use them.
* Chapter 9 "Protocol execution" describes how to execute protocols and how Roboliq handles measurements.
* Chapter 10 "Cookbook" provides examples of various common protocols.
* Chapter 11 "Troubleshooting" tries to help you when you run into problems.
* Chapter 12 "Development" provides further information for programmers who would like to extend or adapt the Roboliq software.

## Software information and conventions {-}

Roboliq accepts several input formats, but in this manual we will use [YAML](http://yaml.olg).
YAML is a very popular format for writing software configuration files.
If you are not familiar with it yet, please checkout [this page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

Some of the advanced programmable features of Roboliq are demonstrated with [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).
Most users won't require knowledge of JavaScript, but if you do need it, there are many good tutorials online.

Many many many thanks to [Prof. Joerg Stelling](http://www.csb.ethz.ch/group/members/person-detail.html?persid=125262) for his guidance during my PhD research developing Roboliq.
[Fabian Rudolf](http://www.csb.ethz.ch/group/members/person-detail.html?persid=104270) was instrumental in determining which features are most relevant for biologists.
[Michael Kaltenbach](http://www.csb.ethz.ch/group/members/person-detail.html.html?persid=157302) provided sage statistical advice while developing the most sophisticated protocols we tested.
[Daniel Meyer and Urs Senn](https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/laf/the-facility/team.html)
provided critical technical support in the lab.
