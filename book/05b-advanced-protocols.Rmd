# Advanced Protocols

More object types:

* [`Variable`](../protocol/commands.html#_Plate): for defining variables that the user can change.
  `Variable` object lets you name a value which can be referenced by name in
  the protocol steps -- this is a good idea if the steps reference the value
	multiple times and you expect to change the value in the future.
* [`Design`](../protocol/commands.html#_Plate): for defining an experimental design.
  The `Design` type facilitates complex experimental designs, and you can read
  more about it in the [Design Documentation]{@tutorial Writing-a-Design}.

Here are examples for each of the four main object types:

```yaml
objects:
  extractionVolume:
    type: Variable
    description: Amount to extract
    value: 100 ul
  design1:
    type: Design
    description: Assign various dilutions to each well on plate1
    conditions:
      ... {properties not included here}
```


## Steps

The `steps` property specifies the actions to be taken.  Normally, this is
a numbered list of commands, such as this example of sealing and shaking
a plate:

```yaml
steps:
  1:
    command: sealer.sealPlate
    object: plate1
  2:
    command: shaker.shakePlate
    object: plate1
```

A *command* is indicated by a `command` property, such as the `sealer.sealPlate`
and `shaker.shakePlate` commands above.
Besides the `command` property, you will need to specify additional properties
to tell the command exactly what to do.  In the above example, the line
`object: plate1` tells the command to act on `plate1`.

A step is either a command or a numbered list of sub-steps.
