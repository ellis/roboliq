This page lists the commands and types made available by the Evoware backend.
Note that:

* Types begin with an uppercase letter, whereas command and namespaces begin with a lowercase
letter.

* A namespace group related commands and types, such as the `pipetter` namespace
contains items relevant to pipetting.  Normally the namespaces will be nouns by
convention.

* As a matter of convention, all commands belong to a namespace.  Normally
commands will start with a verb.  For example, `pipetter.mix` is a command to
use the pipetter to mix well contents.

* Commands and types that begin with an underscore, such as `pipetter._mix`,
are low-level commands.  Normally you will not need to use them and can use
the other higher-level commands instead.
