Evoware commands:
x	asperate
x	dispense
1a	wash
3a	mix
4a	wait
5a	shake
	transfer
	trash
Evoware peripheral commands:
	seal
	peel
	pcr
	filter
	centrifuge
	...
T1 commands:
x	aspirate
x	dispense
1b	clean
3b	mix
4b	wait
5b	shake
	transfer
T2 commands:
1c	pipette liquid
	clean
2a	pipette(List[SrcDestVolume])
2b	copy plate
3c	mix
4c	wait
5c	shake
	transfer
	PCR
	filter/centrifuge
	plate (put drops on a larger plate)
T3 commands:
	pipette liquid (this is like T2, but allows for unset values, and doesn't continue to T1 until all values have been set)
	...
RoboEase commands:
	start implementing these to see what problems I run into
2c	copy plate
Evoware interaction:
	load evoware configuration
4b	create program to monitor overall script progress
4c	send scripts to evoware
4d	recognize when evoware script is done
4e	run some command when evoware script is done
4f	T2_Wait: continue script after specified wait
	T2_
	get data from evoware and peripherals
	user interaction (such as when doing a PCR and don't have a connected PCR machine)
User interface:
	Show user which decisions need/can be made
	Let user specify stuff


Code:
	Continue at: BsseRobot.clean
	have robot decide on Aspiration/Dispense strategy for T1 tokens
	between all tokens is a robot state
	each token has a source reference so that we can ultimately find the line/col of sourcecode which a particular token came from
	each T2 token produces a sequence of T1 tokens
	robot tells which tips can be used in batch for a particular token
	setup unit tests for sbt
	Clean:
		distinguish between 1) clean if dirty and 2) forced preparatory clean
		only clean the tips we'll need
		the pre-clean instruction at the beginning of a pipetting action should clean all tips which will be used during the procedure
		the between-clean instruction should clean all tips which were previously used
		optimize clean instructions so that cleaning of a tip kind also cleans the tips of any clean instructions for that tip kind which come later, but only for clean instruction of the same degree
		optimize clean instructions which are right next to each other so that only one of them is performed
		At the T1 level: tips and degree should already be specified, meaning we need to get the degree information from the BsseRobot
	T0 tokens can have estimated times associated with them
