  # take plate from hotel and put it on the 'cover' location
  # dispense dye into well
  # measure volumes
  # put plate into reader
  # perform readout
  # save reader data
  # take out plate and put it back into the hotel
  
  # tips:
  # 1) four tips
  # pipetting approaches:
  # 1) multipipette liquid to all wells, then readout
  # 2) single pipette to all wells, then readout after all done
  # 3) single pipette, and readout after each dispense
  # readout approach:
  # 1) check level once with the tip it was dispensed with
  # 2) check level with each of the four tips
  # 3) check level multiple times with the tip it was dispensed with
