===========

* single-pipette full plate (and a single tip?) around 22ul using conc 0.08, then conc 0.8 to compare the dyes

* Redo ellis_dye15 using "Water free dispense" modified to use wet contact?  I used Roboliq_Water_Wet_1000 originally, so maybe that wasn't so good
* Figure out low-volume phenomenon for first multipipette dispense
* Test whether performing a more complete wash reduces the gradual drop in the readout
* Test how consistent the problem is with first multi-dispense step
* Test whether we can make multidispense more consistent by performing first dispense into waste

* Use Ellis Nunclon instead

Done
----

* Multipipette 10ul into as many wells as possible in one go with tip 1
* Single pipette 200ul to full plate
* 3ul multi 24
* 200ul single in opposite column direction
* 20ul multi 24

Methods:

Multi-Dispense 12: (50)
Multi-Dispense 24: 3, 5, 10, 20
Multi-Dispense 48: 
Multi-Dispense 84: 10
Multi-Dispense 96: 
Single-Dispense 4T*24: 

Todo in R
=========

* Figure out how to estimate variance for a given target volume (per `key`)
* Give each tip a unique color
* Figure out how to analyze whether there is any bias on a per-well basis
* Experiments with worst variance, grouped by id
* Figure out a good way to visualize the multipipetting vol vs tipVol (tipVolMax vs tipVol, col=vol)

Group data by site, plateModel, liquidClass, totVol, tip <= 4, multipipette > 0.
Possibly group by dye instance (a particular mixture of the dye).

Done
----

* Change `multipipette` to 0 for single dispense, and an integer for the multipetting step otherwise.

Graphs
======

* `readout` ~ `tipVol`, separate graph for each `vol` (color single pipetting readouts differently)
